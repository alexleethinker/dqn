This repository contains a python implementation of [Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://home.uchicago.edu/~arij/journalclub/papers/2015_Mnih_et_al.pdf) using Python and Tensorflow. This is done in the Arcade Learning Environment, as in the original paper.

## Status
The status of this repository is 'Working'. There are a few details that are different from the Deepmind implementation that are work in progress, but the implementation is correct.
